# About This Site

This is a demonstration of Jekyll with GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.

### Key Features:

- **Simple**: No databases, no comment moderation, or pesky updates to installâ€”just your content
- **Static**: Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment
- **Blog-aware**: Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy for free with GitHub Pages

## How GitHub Pages Works

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

### Deployment Options:

1. **Direct from repository**: Push your site files to your repository
2. **GitHub Actions**: Use custom workflows for advanced build processes
3. **Jekyll integration**: Automatic Jekyll builds when you push to your repository

## Getting Started

To create your own GitHub Pages site:

1. Create a new repository named `username.github.io`
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Add an `index.html` file or Jekyll site
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io`

## Custom Domains

You can also use a custom domain with GitHub Pages by:

1. Adding a `CNAME` file to your repository
2. Configuring DNS records with your domain provider
3. Enabling HTTPS in your repository settings
